# Instructions  

Write a program that creates a two-dimensional array initialized with test data. Use any primitive data type that you wish. The program should have the following methods:


getTotal. This method should accept a two-dimensional array as its argument and return the total of all the values in the array.

getAverage. This method should accept a two-dimensional array as its argument and return the average of all the values in the array.

getRowTotal. This method should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The method should return the total of the values in the specified row.

getColumnTotal. This method should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a column in the array. The method should return the total of the values in the specified column.

getHighestInRow. This method should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The method should return the highest value in the specified row of the array.

getLowestInRow. This method should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The method should return the lowest value in the specified row of the array.
